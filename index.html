          <p class="intro">Hi. Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
					<p>I'm glad you decided to check out my page! I created this so I would have a place for people to check out what I am learning.</p>
          <p>Recently I enrolled in Thinkful's web development course. It's been a great learning experience so far! I've been studying & doing all of my work remotely from Los Angeles, CA.</p>

				<div class='item-double'>
          <p>I have been a musician almost all of my life. I found that while touring I seemed to have SO MUCH downtime day-to-day. I was introduced to the world of coding by a family member in 2019 and I haven't stopped learning since!</p>

          <p>I am excited to dive deeper into programming professionally. Being a musician I am almost always working & collaborating with others, and I look forward to doing the same in a development atmosphere! I already have friends who are excited for me to graduate so I can get working on their websites!
